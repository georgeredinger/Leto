<!--
  **NOTE:** This is a template for index.html.
  It uses ejs and htmlWebpackPlugin to generate a different index.html for each environment.
  htmlWebpackPlugin will dynamically add references to the scripts and styles that it bundles
  to this file. The generated bundles have hash-based filenames,
  so it's necessary to add the references dynamically.
  For more info on ejs, see http://www.embeddedjs.com/.
  For examples of using it with htmlWebpackPlugin,
  see https://github.com/jaketrent/html-webpack-template/blob/master/index.ejs
